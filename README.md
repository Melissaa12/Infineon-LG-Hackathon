<br> <b>Problem Statement:</b> Improving safety in vehicles
<br> <b>Main Idea:</b> Employing the use of object detection, a system of sensors and user interface to engage users in the act of safety. This repository will focus on the user interface using WebOS Enact.

<br> <b>Infineon:</b>
Using Infineonâ€™s starter kits,
we utilised the 3D Sense Shield2Go and the magnetic sensors for the steering wheel and seat-belts, detecting when driver is not holding the steering wheel for a period of time or when the seat-belt is not fastened. Optiga Trust is used to secure end-to-end encryption. Which is then compiled using WebSocket communication.
<br>
<br> <b>LG WebOS:</b>
LG-WebOS and Enact.js enabled us to communicate everything into a user interface that users can interact with. Additionally, our object detection also employs WebOs calls YOLO on its system to run via a JS Service, detecting whether it is an object or person, so that children can still be detected irrelevant of their weight, making sure they are wearing seatbelts and not sitting in front seats.
